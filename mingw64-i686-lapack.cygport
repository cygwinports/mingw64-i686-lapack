VERSION=3.7.0
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="Linear Algebra Package for Win32 toolchain"
DESCRIPTION="LAPACK is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving
systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear
systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. LAPACK
routines are written so that as much as possible of the computation is performed
by calls to the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)."
